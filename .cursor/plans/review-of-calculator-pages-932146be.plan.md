# Review of Calculator Pages

## Overview

I will review the `DepositoCalculator.tsx`, `KprCalculator.tsx`, `MultigunaCalculator.tsx`, and `TakeOverCalculator.tsx` components to assess their functionality, user interface/user experience, code quality, performance, and responsiveness based on code analysis.

## Plan

### Phase 1: Code Review for Each Calculator

For each calculator component, I will perform a code-based review focusing on:

-   **Functionality**: Examine input fields, calculation logic, and output display.
-   **UI/UX**: Assess the structure, component usage, and organization within the code.
-   **Code Quality**: Look for readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
-   **Potential Performance/Responsiveness**: Identify any code patterns that might impact performance or responsiveness.

### Phase 2: Summary of Findings

After reviewing all components, I will compile a summary of my findings, highlighting strengths, areas for improvement, and any potential issues identified.

### To-dos

- [ ] Review DepositoCalculator.tsx for functionality, UI/UX, code quality, and potential performance/responsiveness.
- [ ] Review KprCalculator.tsx for functionality, UI/UX, code quality, and potential performance/responsiveness.
- [ ] Review MultigunaCalculator.tsx for functionality, UI/UX, code quality, and potential performance/responsiveness.
- [ ] Review TakeOverCalculator.tsx for functionality, UI/UX, code quality, and potential performance/responsiveness.
- [ ] Summarize findings and provide recommendations for all calculator components.
