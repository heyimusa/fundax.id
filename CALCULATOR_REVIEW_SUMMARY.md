## Overall Assessment

### Strengths:
1. ✅ **DepositoCalculator** - Simple, clean, and fully functional
2. ✅ **KprCalculator** - Feature-rich with excellent UX and comprehensive calculations
3. ✅ **Consistent Design** - All calculators use shadcn/ui components consistently
4. ✅ **Proper Currency Formatting** - Good use of formatCurrency utility
5. ✅ **Responsive Layouts** - All calculators adapt well to different screen sizes
6. ✅ **All Calculators Now Functional** - Multiguna and TakeOver are fully implemented

### Improvements Made:
1. ✅ Fixed all useEffect dependency warnings across all calculators
2. ✅ Added input validation to prevent invalid values
3. ✅ Implemented functional pagination for all tables
4. ✅ Fully implemented MultigunaCalculator with proper calculation logic
5. ✅ Fully implemented TakeOverCalculator with proper calculation logic
6. ✅ Fixed potential infinite loop issues in useEffect hooks

### Code Quality Metrics:
